              <p>A Brief History of the School</p>
            </div>
      
            <p class="history_par">
              Badian National High School, located in the municipality of Badian, Cebu, has a rich history that 
              spans several decades. It was established on July 1, 1948, under the leadership of then-Mayor 
              Vicente Y. Reyes. Initially, the school began as a small institution known as Badian Rural High 
              School, offering secondary education to the local community.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              Over the years, Badian Rural High School underwent several transformations and expansions to 
              accommodate the growing number of students. In 1960, the school was renamed Badian Municipal High 
              School, reflecting its status as a key educational institution in the region. As the demand for 
              quality education continued to rise, the school underwent further development, with additional 
              classrooms, facilities, and academic programs being introduced.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              In 1995, Badian Municipal High School was elevated to the status of a national high school, 
              leading to its current name, Badian National High School. This change in status allowed the school 
              to offer a broader range of academic programs and attract students from neighboring towns and 
              municipalities.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              Throughout its history, Badian National High School has been committed to providing excellent 
              education to its students. It has produced numerous graduates who have excelled in various fields, 
              including academics, sports, and the arts. The school's dedicated faculty and staff have played a 
              crucial role in shaping the minds and talents of the students, ensuring their holistic development.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              Today, Badian National High School continues to be a pillar of education in the municipality, 
              providing a conducive learning environment for its diverse student population. The school prides 
              itself on its strong academic curriculum, extracurricular activities, and commitment to producing 
              well-rounded individuals who are equipped with the necessary skills to succeed in their chosen 
              paths.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              As Badian National High School looks towards the future, it remains dedicated to its mission of 
              molding future leaders and contributing to the growth and progress of the community.

            <p class="history_par">
              The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863 as the Superior 
              Commission of Primary Instruction under a Chairman. The Education agency underwent many 
              reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the 
              changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of Education was eventually 
              mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 
              2001 which establishes the mandate of this agency.
            </p>

            <p class="history_par">
              The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans, 
              programs and projects in the areas of formal and non-formal basic education. It supervises all 
              elementary and secondary education institutions, including alternative learning systems, both 
              public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete, adequate, 
              and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.
